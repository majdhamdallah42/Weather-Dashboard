Description

This Weather Dashboard is designed to provide users with real-time weather updates for both local and global locations. I developed this website to showcase my proficiency in working with APIs, JavaScript, and HTML.


Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, simply open your web browser and navigate to the search bar. Once you have accessed the dashboard, enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather. This will grant you access to weather forecasts for the next 5 days.
